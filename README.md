# UQLT-Constraint-Engine-Core
Frozen, falsifiable constraint-only core of the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT). Defines load-bearing constraints, update semantics, and failure conditions, with a minimal reference implementation and adversarial law-removal tests. No interpretation, ontology, or application is included.


# UQLT-Constraint-Engine-Core

## Overview

This repository records the **constraint-only, falsifiable core engine** underlying the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT).

It defines a closed, prohibition-driven dynamical system specified entirely by explicit constraints, update semantics, admissible halt and failure conditions, and adversarial falsification via single-law removal.

No interpretation, ontology, or application is included.

## Scope

This repository includes only:

- The frozen methods specification of the UQLT constraint engine
- Explicit load-bearing constraints
- Formal falsification criteria
- A minimal, reproducible reference implementation
- Adversarial law-removal verification

---

## Non-Scope

This repository intentionally excludes:

- Physical interpretation
- Cosmological, planetary, biological, or life claims
- Forces, spacetime constructs, or optimization principles
- Parameter fitting, tuning, or empirical alignment
- Visualization, narrative explanation, or metaphor

Any applied, interpretive, or derivative work must occur **only with the express written permission of the author**.

## Authorship and Origin

This work is authored by **Clayton Andrew Houghland**.

The original conception, authorship, and foundational framework of the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT) date to **June 20, 2025**.  
This repository records a formalized core artifact derived from that framework and serves as its authoritative methods spine.
