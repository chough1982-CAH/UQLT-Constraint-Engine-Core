## Scope of This Repository

This repository contains a methods-grade constraint engine and falsification framework.

It exists to:
- Define a closed, constraint-only system
- Specify falsifiable rules and failure conditions
- Provide reproducible reference implementations
- Demonstrate structural load-bearing verification

This repository does not:
- Claim cosmological identity
- Replace existing physical models
- Provide interpretive mappings to legacy physics
- Make predictive or metaphysical claims

Interpretation, application, or extension beyond what is explicitly contained here is not granted.

## Structure & Navigation

This README is not the theory.

Core materials are located in separate files within this repository, including but not limited to:
- Methods spine documents
- Adversarial falsification reports
- Minimal reference implementations
- Regression and removal test harnesses

Readers are expected to treat each file as self-contained and governed by the same restrictions stated above.

If reference to this work is permitted by the author in the future, attribution must include:
- Author name: Clayton Andrew Houghland
- Theory name: Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)
- Original authorship date: June 20, 2025

No paraphrased, anonymized, or indirect attribution is acceptable.
