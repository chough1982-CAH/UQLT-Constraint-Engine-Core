# Constraint-Only Methods Spine
## Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines a **constraint-only generative engine** intended to serve as the foundational methods spine for the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT).

The purpose of this spine is not to model observed phenomena, fit data, or reproduce known physical laws.  
Its purpose is to specify a **closed system of prohibitions, update semantics, and failure conditions** and to determine whether structured outcomes can arise *without* forces, fields, optimization, tuning, or interpretive overlays.

This document is strictly methodological.

No ontology, application, or interpretive mapping is asserted here.

---

## 2. Design Principle

The engine is defined by the following principle:

> **Structure arises only as a consequence of resolving forbidden states under finite constraints.**

Nothing is allowed to occur because it is preferred, efficient, stable, or optimal.  
All change occurs because **some configurations are not permitted to persist**.

This system therefore operates by:
- constraint enforcement
- illegality detection
- irreversible resolution
- termination by global legality or hard failure

---

## 3. State Space

The system consists of a finite discrete lattice.  
Each cell exists in exactly one of the following ordered states:

- EMPTY
- SHELL
- HELIUM
- CORE

States are **ordinal**, not symbolic:
- transitions are monotonic
- no de-escalation is permitted
- no state may be skipped

State labels carry **no physical interpretation** within this document.

---

## 4. Scalar Quantity (Energy)

Each cell carries a scalar value used solely for **constraint accounting**.

This scalar:
- is not conserved
- is not exchanged
- is not diffused
- is not interpreted as physical energy

Its only function is to determine whether a cell violates its state-specific capacity constraint.

---

## 5. Constraints (Load-Bearing Laws)

The engine is governed by the following constraints.  
Each is independently load-bearing.

### C1 — Finite Capacity
Each state has a strict upper bound on its scalar quantity.  
Exceeding this bound renders the cell illegal.

### C2 — Irreversible Escalation
Illegal cells may only resolve by escalating to the next state.  
De-escalation, oscillation, or reversal is prohibited.

### C3 — Boundary Consistency
Cells in higher-order states (HELIUM, CORE) may not exist in isolation.  
A higher-order cell surrounded exclusively by EMPTY neighbors is illegal.

### C4 — Core Protection (Hard Failure)
Illegal CORE states are forbidden to resolve.  
Any illegal CORE state constitutes immediate falsification.

### C5 — Intake Without Diffusion
Scalar accumulation occurs locally and independently.  
No transport, diffusion, averaging, or smoothing is permitted.

### C6 — Resolution by Elimination
Illegal states must be resolved solely by state escalation.  
No scripted collapse, external intervention, or auxiliary rule is allowed.

---

## 6. Update Semantics

Each iteration proceeds in the following fixed order:

1. Scalar intake (per state)
2. Illegality detection
3. Resolution of illegal states
4. Failure check
5. Halt check

Order is non-commutative and mandatory.

No simultaneity assumptions are made; iteration functions only as bookkeeping.

---

## 7. Termination Conditions

The engine terminates under one of two conditions:

### Valid Halt
All cells are legal under all constraints.  
No illegal states remain.

### Hard Failure (Falsification)
An illegal CORE state is detected.

There are no other terminal conditions.

---

## 8. Falsifiability

This system is falsifiable by construction.

A run is considered invalid if:
- structure appears without illegality
- illegality persists without resolution
- collapse requires scripting
- removal of any single constraint preserves legality and structure

Constraint removal tests are mandatory and adversarial.

---

## 9. Interpretation Boundary

This methods spine makes **no claims** regarding:
- gravity
- spacetime
- cosmology
- particles
- forces
- life
- time
- entropy

Any such mappings, if attempted elsewhere, are strictly external and do not modify or extend this document.

This spine stands or fails solely on its internal consistency and falsification behavior.

---

## 10. Status

This document defines a **locked methods core**.

- Constraint set: frozen
- Update semantics: fixed
- Failure conditions: METHODSetation: excluded

Any modification constitutes a new engine and must be treated as such
